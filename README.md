Quach2022

OVERVIEW 
- Original code used for Quach & Chalasani (2022), "Flexible reprogramming of Pristionchus pacificus motivation for attacking Caenorhabditis elegans in predator-prey competition".

STRUCTURE
- egg_distribution: Code used to generate egg distances for analysis of egg distribution in Figures 2B to 2D, S2I.
- patrol_speed: Code used to manually track P. pacificus mouth position and calculate patrol speed for Figures 5A to 5F, 6C to 6D, and S5C to S5F.

EXAMPLES
- To calculate egg distances: Run egg_distribution/calculate_egg_distances.m on egg_distribution/sample_input.
- To calculate patrol, translational, and normalized patrol speeds: Run patrol_speed/calculate_speeds.m on patrol_speed/sample_input/111415_154619575_tracks.mat and patrol_speed/sample_input/111415_154619575_transitions.txt.
